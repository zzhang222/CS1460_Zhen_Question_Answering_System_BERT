When endothelial injury occurs , the endothelial cells stop secretion of coagulation and aggregation inhibitors and instead secrete von Willebrand factor which initiate the maintenance of hemostasis after injury . Hemostasis has three major steps : 1 ) vasoconstriction , 2 ) temporary blockage of a break by a platelet plug , and 3 ) blood coagulation , or formation of a fibrin clot . These processes seal the hole until tissues are repaired ."}, {"name": "Convention on the Rights of the Child", "id": "2911493370352980057", "questions": [{"input_text": "when was united nations convention on the rights of the child created"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "20 November 1989", "span_start": 116, "span_end": 132, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Convention on the Rights of the Child Parties to the convention Only signed , but not ratified Non-signatory Signed 20 November 1989 Location New York City Effective 2 September 1990 Condition 20 ratifications Signatories 140 Parties 196 ( all eligible states except the United States ) Depositary UN Secretary - General Languages Arabic , Chinese , English , French , Russian , Spanish UN Convention on the Rights of the Child at Wikisource"}, {"name": "Code talker", "id": "-1065148654910669702", "questions": [{"input_text": "who were the code talkers and what did they do"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Native Americans in the United States Marine Corps whose primary job was the transmission of secret tactical messages", "span_start": 365, "span_end": 482, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Code talkers are people in the 20th century who used obscure languages as a means of secret communication during wartime .

However , real eggs continue to be used in Eastern European tradition .

'' This custom of the Easter egg can be traced to early Christians of Mesopotamia , and from there it spread into Russia and Siberia through the Orthodox Churches , and later into Europe through the Catholic and Protestant Churches .

Some members of the Women 's Social and Political Union ( WSPU , commonly referred to as suffragettes ) had been imprisoned for acts of vandalism in support of women 's suffrage . In protest to being imprisoned some of these suffragettes undertook hunger strikes . These suffragettes were then force - fed leading to a public outcry . This act was a response to the outcry ; it allowed the prisoners to be released on licence as soon as the hunger strike affected their health . They then had a period of time in which they could recover . After a predetermined period of time the prisoner would be rearrested to serve out the rest of their sentence . Conditions could be placed on the prisoner during the time of their release . The hunger strikes themselves were now technically legal . However , the Act allowed for the re-imprisonment of the hunger strikers upon their recovery on their original charges . The nickname of the Act came about because of a cat 's habit of playing with its prey ( a mouse ) before finishing it off ."}, {"name": "Lord Howe Island", "id": "7074317315274630741", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did lord howe island became a world heritage site"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "1982", "span_start": 1096, "span_end": 1100, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Lord Howe Island Satellite image of the island ; north is up .

The controlled synthesis of materials as thin films ( a process referred to as deposition ) is a fundamental step in many applications . A familiar example is the household mirror , which typically has a thin metal coating on the back of a sheet of glass to form a reflective interface . The process of silvering was once commonly used to produce mirrors , while more recently the metal layer is deposited using techniques such as sputtering . Advances in thin film deposition techniques during the 20th century have enabled a wide range of technological breakthroughs in areas such as magnetic recording media , electronic semiconductor devices , LEDs , optical coatings ( such as antireflective coatings ) , hard coatings on cutting tools , and for both energy generation ( e.g. thin - film solar cells ) and storage ( thin - film batteries ) . It is also being applied to pharmaceuticals , via thin - film drug delivery . A stack of thin films is called a multilayer ."}, {"name": "Colon Street", "id": "8324017764283655875", "questions": [{"input_text": "what is the oldest street in the philippines"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Colon Street", "span_start": 0, "span_end": 12, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Colon Street is a historical street in downtown Cebu City that is often called the oldest and the shortest national road in the Philippines .

Gastric acid is produced by cells in the lining of the stomach , which are coupled in feedback systems to increase acid production when needed . Other cells in the stomach produce bicarbonate , a base , to buffer the fluid , ensuring that it does not become too acidic . These cells also produce mucus , which forms a viscous physical barrier to prevent gastric acid from damaging the stomach . The pancreas further produces large amounts of bicarbonate and secretes bicarbonate through the pancreatic duct to the duodenum to completely neutralize any gastric acid that passes further down into the digestive tract ."}, {"name": "Stephen Curry", "id": "8968036245733884389", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did stephen curry won the mvp award"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "2015 , 2016", "span_start": 617, "span_end": 628, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Stephen Curry Curry in 2016 No. 30 -- Golden State Warriors Position Point guard League NBA ( 1988 - 03 - 14 ) March 14 , 1988 ( age 29 ) Akron , Ohio Nationality American Listed height 6 ft 3 in ( 1.91 m ) Listed weight 190 lb ( 86 kg ) Career information High school Charlotte Christian ( Charlotte , North Carolina ) College Davidson ( 2006 -- 2009 ) NBA draft 2009 / Round : 1 / Pick : 7th overall Selected by the Golden State Warriors Playing career 2009 -- present Career history 2009 -- present Golden State Warriors Career highlights and awards 2 \u00d7 NBA champion ( 2015 , 2017 ) 2 \u00d7 NBA Most Valuable Player ( 2015 , 2016 ) 5 \u00d7 NBA All - Star ( 2014 -- 2018 ) 2 \u00d7 All - NBA First Team ( 2015 , 2016 ) 2 \u00d7 All - NBA Second Team ( 2014 , 2017 ) NBA scoring champion ( 2016 ) NBA steals leader ( 2016 ) 50 -- 40 -- 90 club ( 2016 ) NBA Three - Point Contest champion ( 2015 ) NBA Sportsmanship Award ( 2011 ) NBA All - Rookie First Team ( 2010 ) AP Athlete of the Year ( 2015 ) Consensus first - team All - American ( 2009 ) Consensus second - team All - American ( 2008 ) NCAA Division I scoring leader ( 2009 ) 2 \u00d7 SoCon Player of the Year ( 2008 , 2009 ) Stats at NBA.com Stats at Basketball-Reference.com Medals ( hide ) Men 's basketball Representing United States FIBA World Cup 2010 Turkey National team 2014 Spain National team"}, {"name": "Tomato pur\u00e9e", "id": "-6731660837492850061", "questions": [{"input_text": "whats the difference between tomato paste and tomato puree"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "consistency", "span_start": 145, "span_end": 156, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Tomato pur\u00e9e is a thick liquid made by cooking and straining tomatoes .

In ray diagrams ( such as the images on the right ) , real rays of light are always represented by full , solid lines ; perceived or extrapolated rays of light are represented by dashed lines . A real image occurs where rays converge , whereas a virtual image occurs where rays only appear to converge ."}, {"name": "Adidas Yeezy", "id": "-5548201381317088445", "questions": [{"input_text": "when did the first pair of yeezys come out"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "February 14 , 2015", "span_start": 189, "span_end": 207, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "Adidas Yeezy Boost is the official collaboration sneaker by Kanye West and Adidas .

There are two forms of plasmodesmata : primary plasmodesmata , which are formed during cell division , and secondary plasmodesmata , which can form between mature cells ."}, {"name": "R/T", "id": "-3719623571078658627", "questions": [{"input_text": "what does rt mean on a dodge car"}], "answers": [{"candidate_id": 0, "span_text": "Road / Track", "span_start": 129, "span_end": 141, "input_text": "short"}], "has_correct_context": true, "contexts": "R / T is the performance marker used on Dodge automobiles since the 1960s ( much like Chevrolet Super Sport ) .
